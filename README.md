  - TypeScript support

- **Backend:**
  - Powered by [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for high-performance APIs
  - Async endpoints
  - Automatic OpenAPI/Swagger docs
  - CORS enabled for frontend-backend communication

- **Project Structure:**
  - Clean separation between frontend and backend
  - Easy-to-understand folder organization
